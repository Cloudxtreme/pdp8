# Simple PDP5/PDP8 emulator

## Usage
The all-in-one shellscript, and a ramdump file (siralom.pal) should be in the same folder.
From bash CLI enter as an executable command:

```
/home/etelkoz$ ./pdp8.sh
```

## TODO
A lot. Cleanup, optimization, add keyboard, add monitor IF, add support for bash 3.x in OSX etc.
